Permanently delete a page and its fields.
-----------------------------------------

Unlike `$pages->trash()`, pages deleted here are not restorable.

If you attempt to delete a page with children, and donâ€™t specifically set the `$recursive` argument to `true`, then this method will throw an exception. If a recursive delete fails for any reason, an exception will be thrown.

Hook note:  
If you want to hook this method, please hook the `deleteReady`, `deleted`, or `Pages::delete` method instead, as hooking this method will not hook relevant pages deleted directly through $pages->delete().

### Usage

    // basic usage
    $bool = $pagesType->delete(Page $page);
    
    // usage with all arguments
    $bool = $pagesType->delete(Page $page, bool $recursive = false);

### Arguments

`recursive` (optional)

### Exceptions
