Returns the Pageâ€™s path from the ProcessWire installation root.
---------------------------------------------------------------

The path is always indicated from the ProcessWire installation root. Meaning, if the installation is running from a subdirectory, then the path does not include that subdirectory, whereas the url does. Note that path and url are identical if installation is not running from a subdirectory.

### Example

    // Difference between path and url on site running from subdirectory /my-site/
    echo $page->path(); // outputs: /about/contact/
    echo $page->url();  // outputs: /my-site/about/contact/

### Usage

    $string = $page->path();

### Return value

`string`

Returns the page path, for example: `/about/contact/`
